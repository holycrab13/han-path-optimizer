# Han Path Optimizer

Implementation of the algorithm suggested in https://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SOCS/SOCS20/paper/view/18524 by Han et al. as a mod for the Unity A* Pathfinding Project by Aron Granberg. The script is implemented as a MonoMod. Can be combined with other MonoMods.

Takes a 4-directional path as input and tries to find as many non-blocked any-angle diagonal paths as possible.

I found some rare cases of local errors but was unable to nail them down so far. 
All feedback greatly appreciated!
